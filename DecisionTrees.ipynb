    "## `DecisionTree` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct a `DecisionTree` class in the cell below.  It should support the standard scikit-learn API: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> X, y = <your_dataset>\n",
    ">>> model = DecisionTree() # potentially with some parameters, if needed\n",
    ">>> model.fit(X,y)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your `predict` function should support either single predictions or multiple predictions, though you can force the user to do single predictions as a 2d array (single-row \"multiple\" predictions) so you only have one implementation to write.  What I mean by this is `model.predict(X)` should work (without error) to create all predictions for `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should construct some human-readable visualization of your model, simply from a printout.  This way you can tell if the model is being built the way you want.  The best way to do this is to implement the `__str__` method for your class.  Probably the easiest way to do this is to iterate through the tree in a \"depth-first\" fashion, and for each node, just print out some basic facts, like the number of elements in that node, or the indices of those elements in `X`, and the class assignment if it's a leaf node; also, make sure the indentation level of each node increases as its depth increases.  It might be helpful to have your nodes be more than just the bare minimum object (which would probably be a list of the indices of the rows in `X` for the items in your node).  To reiterate: this should NOT be a \"beautiful\" printout with lines like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "            root\n",
    "           /    \\\n",
    "     child1      child2 \n",
    "    /      \\    /      \\\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because that would get awkward fast.  What I'm imagining is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "root: <root_info>\n",
    "  child1: <child1_info>\n",
    "    grandchild1: <grandchild1_info>\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    grandchild1: <grandchild2_info>\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "  child2: <child2_info>\n",
    "    grandchild1: <grandchild1_info>\n",
    "    grandchild1: <grandchild2_info>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing this in `__str__` for your class, this will be the printout when you run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "model = DecisionTree(<whatever_you_need_to_do_to_create_your_model>)\n",
    "model.fit(X,y)\n",

    "Recall the algorithm for fitting a decision tree:\n",
    "1. Start with all your data samples in a single node.\n",
    "2. For a given node, determine if you want to split at that node or not.  For now, this should just be a check to see if the node is \"pure\", meaning it only contains one class.  If you do decide to split it further, compute all possible splits of your data (all possible depth-1 subtrees).  For categorical variables, this should look like generating all pairs of combinations of classes.  For continuous or ordinal variables, sort the entries in that column, and then all possible splits involve cutting off at values between adjacent entries.  That is, if the entries in my continuous column are `[2.01, 3.425, 8.67, 493.6]`, then I have three splits, which are \n",
    "\"$x_i\\leq 2.01$\", \"$x_i\\leq 3.425$\", \"$x_i\\leq 8.67$\".\n",
    "3. Compute the change in Gini Impurity for each split, and choose the split that has the largest gain in information (most pure nodes).  Recall that the Gini Impurity for a node is \n",
    "$$ I = 1 - \\sum_{\\text{each class}} \\left(\\frac{\\text{# of elements in that class}}{\\text{# of elements in the node}}\\right)^2$$\n",
    "So then you want to maximize $I_\\text{new_child1} + I_\\text{new_child2} - I_\\text{old}$; that is, choose the split with the largest value for that quantity (roughly interpretted as \"information gain\", though for the record the term \"information gain\" is used in a totally-synonymous-but-technically-different situation).\n",
    "4. Repeat until all nodes are pure.\n",
    "5. (Get the above working first, and then later:) prune the tree back to avoid overfitting your training data. (See below)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your (Python) class should work for multi-class datasets (where you're trying to predict a `y` that has more than two classes)."

The [Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) is a tutorial challenge which has you attempting to predict whether someone did or did not die on board the Titanic, based on their criteria.  In order to download the dataset, you'll need to make an account, and agree to some scary-sounding agreement about not sharing their data with the world (to make their legal team happy).  Do only the minimum of data cleanup on it, trash the name column (unless you want to get really fancy), and fit a decision tree to the dataset.  Make sure to save some data for testing purposes.\n",

Do this until you stop seeing improvements on the validation set.  Here a validation set means a third split of data, different from test and train.  It's different from the training set because you're not training the model on it, but it's also not testing data because you're changing your model based on knowledge gained from the dataset.

What you normally do is build a __forest__ of trees, that is, a collection of several trees (a common number is 50-500 trees), and then have them vote.  However, if you let your trees build themselves from the same exact datasets each time, they will be roughly the same, and the power of this voting model will be irrelevant.  Thus, one extremely common model is called the __Random Forest__ classifier: give each tree only a subset of the features to train from, don't prune at all (allow them to overfit on that subset), and then have them vote.  This increases the variance of the distribution of tree votes, which helps to average out the errors.  Create a new Python class that builds this classification model.  Note that Random Forests are a current industry favorite (among other things, like support vector machines, boosted trees, and neural networks), meaning if you do this you'll have created a model capable of hacking it with some of the best!\n",
